			<h1>Jessie-Marie Heath</h1>
			<h2>Junior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
			<p>My name is Jessie-Marie Heath. I am a Junior studying Sport Management. 
			   With this major I hope to one day be an Assistant Coach for the Denver Broncos.
			   I have a big passion for running. I currently am a runner on the Bob Jones 
		           Cross Country team.  </p>
			<p>I graduated in May with my Associates in Health and Fitness Training.
			I like to help people try and eat better. I also like to help them live 
			a healthy lifestyle with being physically active. I especially love to work
			with young kids. I help out with a bible club here in Greenville at the church
			Freedom Baptist.
